I dropped a complete, one-file website you can host on GitHub Pages right away. It includes a clean hero, “ways to make money” guides, a 7-day roadmap (with a downloadable checklist), a newsletter form placeholder, SEO/OG tags, and a “Fork on GitHub” ribbon.

Quick start:

1. Create a new GitHub repo (public), name it anything.


2. Add the file I provided as index.html at the repo root.


3. Commit → Settings → Pages → “Deploy from a branch” → select main and /root. Save.


4. Your site will publish at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/.


5. Edit the placeholders: repo links, your name, and social URLs.
